        <h1> About the team</h1>
        <br>
        This site was made by the Girls Who Code Young Women Tech Leaders at the Queens Central Y. As young high school
        students themselves, the College Classifed team wanted to make applying to college accessible to other young girls. Throughout
        the winter and spring of 2017, they and their two Girls Who Code facilitators worked long and hard each week to
        code the website you are reading now from scratch. They hope to inspire and encourage more girls in STEM
        and encourage girls to apply to college.
